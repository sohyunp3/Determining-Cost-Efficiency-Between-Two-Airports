# CS 225 Data Structures

## Team Contract (jyjeong2-jdoo2-sc27-sohyunp3 )

### Communication
**Team Meetings**: Our team meetings will be held over Zoom once a week every Thursday 
from 6 to 8 PM. There will be a shared Google Docs folder containing documents to 
write notes about each meeting and progress. Each team member will take turns every 
week writing notes and writing the progress log. All team members will check the notes 
and progress log written that week.

**Assistance**: All team members can be reached via email, text, and other messenger apps.

**Respect**: All team members will respect each other’s opinions and proposals regarding
the project. Any potential changes regarding the project will be voted on. Decisions
will be made based on majority vote. 

### Collaboration
**Work Distribution**: Each week, members will collaborate to complete the tasks required.
If possible, tasks will be divided among the members to ensure a fair workload for all 
members.

**Time Commitment**: To ensure a fair workload, all members will discuss how to divide the 
required tasks so that everyone will spend a similar amount of time every week. Ideal 
time consumption is approximately 3 to 6 hours per week. If one member has issues or 
struggles with the tasks or has personal issues, other members will assist that member 
since it is the team’s responsibility to complete and stay on progress. Unless there 
are understandable circumstances, all members will be expected to finish their expected 
workload.

**Conflict Resolution**: Conflicts within the group will be resolved by all members giving 
their thoughts on the matter and keeping discussions as civilized as possible.
